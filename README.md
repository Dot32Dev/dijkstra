# Dijkstra's algorithm
An implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm built from the explanation I received in my graph theory maths class.

I took this weighted graph from a lecture and represented it in code as an edge weight matrix, though I renamed the vertices to start from zero due to indexing.

Astonishingly it worked first try! 
The first run is pathfinding from v0 to v4, and the second is path finding from v0 to v1. If you subtract one from the vertex numbers in the graph you can see that this path is correct.
